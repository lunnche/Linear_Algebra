Four Fundamental Subspaces   四种基本子空间？

* nullspace
* column space of $A^T$ 第三章讲  
* nullspace of $A^T$  

The crucial operation in linear algebra is to take linear combinations of column vectors.  

this is exactly the result of a matrix-vector multiplication  

$Ax$ is a combination of the columns of A  

When we take all combinations Ax of the column vectors,We get the column space. If this space includes the vector b,we can solve the equation $Ax=b$  

Ax=b The solution vector x comes at three levels and all are important:
1. <ins>Direct solution</ins> to find x by forward elimination and back substitution.  
2. <ins>Matrix solution</ins> using the inverse matrix: $x=A^{-1}b$ (if A has an inverse)  
3. <ins>Particular solution</ins> (to $Ay=b$) plus nullspace solution(to $Az=0$)  

Direct elimination is the most frequently used algorithm in scientific computing.  

even a supercomputer doesn't want the inverse matrix: too slow.  
Inverse give the simplest formula $x=A^{-1}b$ but not the top speed. And everyone must know the determinants are even slower.  

this book numbers $\rightarrow$ vectors $\rightarrow$ subspaces  

The truth is that vectors and matrices have become the language to know.  

The greatest encouragement of all is the feeling that you are doing something worthwile with your life.  

新书 Linear Algebra and Learning from Data.  textbook for the applied linear algebra course 18.065 at MIT.  

The goal of deep learning is to find patterns in the training data. Matrix multiplication is interwoven with the nonlinear ramp function $ReLU(x)=max(0,x)$. The result is a learning function that can interpret new data.  

## Chapter 1 Introduction to Vectors  

The heart of linear algebra is in two operations,both with vectors.  
we add vectors to get v+w.We mutiply them by numbers c and d to get $cv$ and $dw$,Combing those two operations(adding cv to dw) gives the linear combination $cv+dw$.  

Linear combination:  


$$
cv+dw=c
\left[
\begin{matrix}
1\\
1
\end{matrix}
\right]+d
\left[
\begin{matrix}
2\\
3
\end{matrix}
\right]=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
c+2d\\
c+3d
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

Sometimes we want one particular combination,the specific shoice c=2 and d=1 that produces cv+dw=(4,5),Other times we want all the combinations of v and w(coming from all c and d).  

The vectors cv lie along a line. When w is not on that line, the combination cv+dw fill the whole two-dimensional plane.  

The really impressive feature fo linear algebra is how smoothly it takes that step into n-dimensional space.You mental picture stays completely correct even if drawing a ten-dimensional vector is impossible.  

vector addition:
$$
v=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
v_1\\
v_2
\end{matrix}
\right] \ \ and\ \ w=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
w_1\\
w_2
\end{matrix}
\right]\\
\\
\downarrow\\
\\
v+w=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
v_1+w_1\\
v_2+w_2
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

scalar multiplication:  
$$
2v=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
2v_1\\
2v_2
\end{matrix}
\right]=v+v
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -v=
\left[
\begin{matrix}
-v_1\\
-v_2
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

Notice: sum of -v and v is the zero vector.This is 0 which is not the same as the number zero!  
The vector 0 has components 0 and 0.  

Linear algebra is built on these operations v+w and cv and dw, adding vectors and multiplying by scalars.  

The sum of cv and dw is a linear combination cv+dw  

The zero vector is always a possible combination( its coefficients are zero).Every time we see a "space" of vectors,then zero vector will be included.  

We have three ways to describe v:
1. Two numbers  
2. Arrow from (0,0)  
3. Point in the plane  

We add using the numbers.We visualize u+w using arrows:  

vector addition(head to tail)  At the end of v,place the start of w.  

w+v gives the same answer as v+w.  

三维向量 $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$  

There is a perfect match between the column vector and the arrow from the origin and the point where the arrow ends.

From now on $v=\left[\begin{matrix}1\\1\\-1\end{matrix}\right]$ is also written as $v=(1,1,-1)$

The reason for the fow form(in parentheses)is to save space.But v=(1,1,-1) is not a row vector!It is in actuality column vector.  

The row vector [1 1 -1]（没逗号）is absolutely different.  
1 by 3 row vector is the "transpose" of the 3 by 1 column vector v.  

Questions:  
if the combination cu+dv+ew fill three-dimensional space.When w happens to be cu+dv,that third vector w is
in the plane of the first two.The combination of u,v,w will not go outside that uv plane.We do not get the full three-dimensional space.  

看个例子:

怎么判断 二维向量是否填满二维空间  三个向量是否填满三维空间？
就是看其中一个 向量是否能表示为其他向量的linear combination,
或者换种说法，看这n个向量是否有个linear combination 得到zero vector.

看这个例子：  
Every combination of v=(1,-2,1)and w=(0,1,-1) has components that add to (?).Find c and d so that cv+dw=(3,3,-6).Why is (3,3,6) impossible?  
可以注意到v和w每一个component 加起来都为0 ，所以它俩的任何linear combination各component 加起来都为0，而（3，3，6)加起来不为0.
